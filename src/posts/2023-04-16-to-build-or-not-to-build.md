## Weighing the Pros and Cons of Building Unreal Engine from Source

In a quiet chamber of the ancient academy, a student named Theodoros approached the wise and renowned, Diokles.  With a burning curiosity in his heart, Theodoros sought the guidance of the Sr Developer in determining whether or not to compile Unreal Engine from source.

Theodoros: Oh, Diokles, I have come to seek your wisdom. I am faced with a decision of utmost importance, and I hope you will guide me. Should I build Unreal Engine from source or not?

Diokles: Ah, Theodoros, a question as ancient as the lines of source code themselves.  What do you wish to accomplish in this endeavor?

Theodoros: I seek to understand the inner workings of the engine, to delve into its complexities, and to master its secrets.

Diokles: Indeed, a noble pursuit. Building the engine from source will offer you a deep understanding of its architecture, and you will learn the intricacies of its code base. You will become familiar with the tools and techniques, and you will discover how this titan of game development was crafted.

Theodoros: Wouldn't it be easier to just install it like a normal person?

Diokles: Just as the gods of old bestowed powers upon their chosen heroes, so too will this knowledge empower you. You will be able to customize the engine, and fix bugs without waiting for a patch.  Over time, your understanding will help you fine tune performance issues.

Theodoros: Then why do so many indie game devs fail in this endeavor?

Diokles: The pitfalls are many, young Theodoros. The path is fraught with challenges; and, many fall victim to frustration and impatience.  Building the engine from source requires time and dedication, for it is complex and continuously improved. The compilation process will be slow, especially if you try to use a hard disk drive.  You will encounter errors and obstacles that will test your resolve.

Theodoros: I think I'm beginning to understand.

Diokles: To build the Unreal Engine from source is to embark on a journey of discovery, where one's skills and knowledge are honed, but also a journey that demands patience, persistence, and resilience in the face of challenges.

With newfound clarity and resolve, the young Theodoros thanked Diokles and prepared to embark on his journey, knowing that the road ahead would be arduous, but the knowledge gained would be priceless. And so began the epic tale of Theodoros and the Unreal Engine, a story that would echo through history for generations.
